This is a basic user dashboard to create and edit users. Users can edit their own profile including a little blurb about themselves. Admin level users can edit the log in credentials of other users (lol). You can also make yourself an administrator during the registration process (lolol).

It has been deployed on AWS using gunicorn and Nginx. 

**UPDATE**: Now styled with Bootstrap!
